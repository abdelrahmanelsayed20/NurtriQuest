# NutriQuest 💪

A sophisticated nutrition and workout information retrieval system that helps users find personalized diet and exercise plans.

## About NutriQuest

NutriQuest is an advanced information retrieval application that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide users with relevant nutrition and workout information. The application allows users to search for diet plans, workout routines, and health advice from multiple sources including fitness websites, nutrition databases, and research articles.

## Features

- **Intelligent Search**: Utilizes BM25 ranking algorithm and TF-IDF for accurate information retrieval
- **Query Expansion**: Automatically enhances user queries with related terms for better search results
- **Multi-source Search**: Filters results by specific information sources
- **NLP Processing**: Implements tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal for improved search precision
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates precision, recall, F1 score, and NDCG to evaluate search quality
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit web application interface
- **AI-powered Chatbot**: Interactive assistant that provides personalized nutrition and fitness advice
